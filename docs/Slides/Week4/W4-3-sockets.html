# Part 1: Websockets, background

---

# Problems with request-reply (Why Websockets?)

* Server cannot answer without request from client (server cannot push)
* Performance issues
* Pull paradigm
* Polling
* Slow (=reply from server comes when it's requested)
* Eats resources (unnecessary responses and requests)

---

# Websockets

* Websockets makes it possible to 
  * **push messages** from server to client
  * have **persistent, two-way connections** between server and client
  * have blazing-fast messaging
* Client subscribes / starts listening (future) messages (from server)
* Server sends messages them whenever it likes
* Example on publish-subscribe: PubSubHubbub https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5kHx0rGkec
* **Note:** communication is connected and "stateful", and (also) thus different from Rest paradigm

---

# Websockets

* [RFC 7936: The Websocket protocol](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6455)
* New (application level) protocol, runs on TCP
* Protocol prefix: WS or WSS

---

# Websockets in Node.js

* Many libraries exist, e.g. [WS](https://github.com/websockets/ws), [UWS](https://github.com/uWebSockets/bindings/tree/master/nodejs) and [Socket.io](https://socket.io/)
* Today, we will concentrate on **Socket.io**
  * Socket.io: stable, well documented
  * High-level functionalities for messaging and session management
  * Easy to use
  * [Fallback](http://www.jonahnisenson.com/how-does-socket-io-fallback-to-xhr-or-jsonp/) to HTTP / longpolling
* Can have several [concurrent connections](https://blog.jayway.com/2015/04/13/600k-concurrent-websocket-connections-on-aws-using-node-js/)
---

# Why to use Websockets?

* Real time messaging
* (For live video / audio, prefer WebRTC)
* Use cases
  * Social media, chat
  * Gaming
  * Remote commands 
  * Collecting sensor data 
  * Collaborative apps
  * etc.

---

# Why not Websockets?

* REST is enough
* No need for continuous real-time messaging
* Bit more difficult to implement than REST
* States, sessions

# Part 2: Hands-on Socket.io

---

# Socket.io

* [Server API](https://socket.io/docs/server-api/)
* [Client API](https://socket.io/docs/client-api/)
* Server: npm install socket.io
* Client: load [library](https://github.com/socketio/socket.io-client/tree/master/dist)

---

# Socket.io / [Server](https://gist.github.com/OAlm/d1d58723fc509ae632c76ac6e8dd7dd0)

```javascript
'use strict';
const app = require('express')();
const server = require('http').Server(app);
const io = require('socket.io')(server);

io.on('connection', function(socket) {
    const socketid = socket.id;
    console.log('a user connected with session id '+socket.id);
    
    socket.on('disconnect', function() {
        console.log('user disconnected');
    });

    socket.on('message', function(jsonMsg) {
        console.log('received message from client: '+JSON.stringify(jsonMsg));
        socket.emit('message', 'Server says: whatsupp?');
    });
   }
);

server.listen(3000, function() {
    console.log('Server started (3000)');
});
```

---

# Socket.io / [Client](https://gist.github.com/OAlm/a1c4a5913120ff604555a1b1bdfce745)

```html
<script src="socket.io.js"></script>
<script>
  var socket = io.connect('http://localhost:3000');
  socket.on('message', function (data) {
    console.log('got message from server: '+data);
  });
  socket.on('connect', function() {
        console.log('socket.io connected!');
  });
  socket.on('disconnect', function() {
        console.log('socket.io connected!');
  });

  function sendMsg() {
    console.log('send msg');
    let msg = {};
    msg.app_id = this.appName;
    msg.time = Date.now();
    msg.json = 'json';
    // socket.json.emit('message', msg);
    socket.emit('message', 'Client says: how are you?');
  }

  setTimeout(sendMsg, 1000);
</script>
```

# Socket.io, core parts

* Both client & server connect
* Receiving messages: *socket.on('message', ...*
* Client can be identified by *session.id*
* Server has *rooms*, channels for grouping messages
* [Sending messages](https://gist.github.com/alexpchin/3f257d0bb813e2c8c476):
  * **socket.emit** to sender only
  * **io.emit** to all clients
  * **socket.broadcast.emit** to all clients except sender
  * **socket.broadcast.to('room').emit** to room, to all clients except sender
  * **socket.join('some room')** join room (server side)
  * **socket.leave('some room')** leave1 room (server side)

# Tasks for the afternoon (April 11th)

0. For the experiments with your friends, you might like to deploy your app into Jelastic
1. Create a website, with input text, which will be broadcasted to other people in the same page
2. Add a textfield for a user to give a nickname (e.g. *Olli* says "Hello")
3. Add rooms in your app: User can choose a room where she belongs to, and messages posted into a room
4. What are namespaces in Socket.io? How they are different from rooms?
5. Let me know how you could utilize websockets in your project.

**Note:** If you like, you can replace sending text with other data, like graphics, sensor data, sound, video...
