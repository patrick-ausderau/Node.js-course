#### Excercise/Homework
  * create new github/gitlab/bitbucket/... remote git repository 'npm-test' (include Readme.md, .gitignore and license)
  * clone your repository locally (e.g. in your IDE's project folder)
  * start npm project in the cloned repository
  * do all/most exercises from the link above
  * use git to publish your change to the server (git add/commit/push locally and git pull on the remote server)

Note: you can try [postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) to test your routes (e.g. before you implement html form or ES6 fetch).
